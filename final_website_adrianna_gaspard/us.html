                <h2>What is <cite>Us</cite> About?</h2>
                <p>
                    Accompanied by her husband, son and daughter, Adelaide Wilson returns to the beachfront home where she grew up as a child. Haunted by a traumatic experience from the past, Adelaide grows increasingly concerned that something bad is going to happen. Her worst fears soon become a reality when four masked strangers descend upon the house, forcing the Wilsons into a fight for survival. When the masks come off, the family is horrified to learn that each attacker takes the appearance of one of them.

                <h2>Understanding the Main Character</h2>
                <p>
                    Lupita Nyong'o stars as Us' main protagonist and antagonist. On one hand, she plays Adelaide Wilson, a loving wife and mother of two who just wants her family to have a memorable vacation. On the other, she's Red, the nefarious leader of The Tethered, who stops at nothing to torture her counterpart.

                <h2>A Look at the Rest of the Characters</h2>
                <p>
                    Winston Duke portrays Gabe Wilson, a protective, sometimes goofy husband and father. His Tethered persona, Abraham, is much more sinister, using brute force and communicating only through grunts. Shahadi Wright Joseph plays the Wilson's daughter, Zora. But don't let Zora's friendly nature fool you; her Tethered counterpart, Umbrae, is skin-crawlingly scary. Evan Alex plays the Wilson's youngest child, Jason, and is the first character to encounter one of The Tethered on the beach. Though he appears sweet and non-confrontational in the real world, his doppelgänger, Pluto, is fearless. Elisabeth Moss plays housewife Kitty Tyler and her malicious Tethered counterpart, Dahlia. Tim Heidecker plays Josh Tyler, Kitty's wealthy husband and close friend of the Wilsons. His doppelgänger goes by Tex.

                <p>My favorite scene in this move is when Adelaide and Red are fighting. I was so on edge when I first saw the scene and I really wanted to see who would win the fight. This scene was very interesting to me because after Adelaide won, it was revealed that she was the real tethered one the whole time, which was a good twist.</p>
