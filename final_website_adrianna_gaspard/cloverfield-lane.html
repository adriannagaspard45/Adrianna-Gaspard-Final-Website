                <h2>What is <cite>10 Cloverfield Lane</cite> About?</h2>
                <p>
                    After surviving a car accident, Michelle wakes up to find herself in an underground bunker with two men. Howard tells her that a massive chemical attack has rendered the air unbreathable, and their only hope of survival is to remain inside. Despite the comforts of home, Howard's controlling and menacing nature makes Michelle want to escape. After taking matters into her own hands, the young woman finally discovers the truth about the outside world.

                <h2>Understanding the Main Character</h2>
                <p>
                    Michelle is the main protagnoist of 10 Cloverfield Lane. Going through Louisiana, Michelle goes to a gas station to refuel her car and notices a man in a pickup truck watching her. While driving, Michelle is contacted by Ben, her husband, who begs her to come back and to stop running away. After hearing on the radio that a power surge is happening, she is knocked off the road when she is contacted by Ben once again.

                <h2>A Look at the Rest of the Characters</h2>
                <p>
                    Howard Stambler, played by John Goodman, is the main antagonist of 10 Cloverfield Lane. He was a former US Sailor who worked with satellites. He and his teammates discovered a terrible secret about the future of the world. After that he became paranoid and began to prepare himself for an unknown threat of some kind. Emmett Dewitt, played by John Gallagher Jr. is one of the main characters. Before the events of the movie, he was hired by Howard to help build his bunker.

                    I have a few favorite scenes in this movie, but the one I'd say is my most favorite is when Michelle finally escapes and tries to leave. She realizes that what Howard was telling her has been true all along and now she has to fight again to escape from another danger. The intensity and thrill of the scene is what I really like about it.
